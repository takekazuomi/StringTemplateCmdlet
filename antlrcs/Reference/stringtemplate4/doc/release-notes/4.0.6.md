# 4.0.6 Release Notes

September 26, 2012

This is a bug fix release. (Download ST v4 here)

* STRawGroupDir problem and ST("template") issue. When there are no formal args for template t and you map t across some values, t implicitly gets arg "it". E.g., `$names:bold()$` and bold as `<b>$it$</b>`.
* Fixed https://github.com/antlr/stringtemplate4/issues/5
* Made fields in the error messages public
